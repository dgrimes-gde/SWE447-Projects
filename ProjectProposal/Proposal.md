FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL

OVERVIEW:

For my final project proposal I plan to recreate a Simon Says Game from scratch. I will be using four colors well known on the spectrum green, red, blue and yellow. For those who do not know how simon says works it's a big game of horse where you mimic the color patterns that are executed before your turn. This will be a challenging as well as an enjoyable project to embark on for the last five weeks of this course. 

SEQUENCE OF PROGRESSIONS:

Week 1 - Collect Game Assets that would be implemented into Simon Says. Picture of four colors and foreground image. 
Week 2 - Establish basic functionality with Game Assets making sure all colors blink accordingly. Making sure all requirements are being met 
Week 3 - Implement multiple reset patterns for the colors to blink in order.
Week 4 - Maintain full functionality and implementation allowing the user to have multiple playthroughs with no bugs or setbacks.
Week 5 - (Stretch Goal)- Present final iteration of Simon Says with the extra 4 adjacent button colors receiving feedback and test results from my instructor and class on completion.


IMPLEMENTATION: 

I intend to implement my final project proposal through three.js if possible to create the application from scratch, but If not I plan to use some web-based source to render the application.

REQUIREMENTS:

Minimum 5 objects.Device, Green Button, Red Button, Blue Button, and Yellow Button
Animating object Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow glow animation. 
Model of Simon Handheld (Rendered and Textured)

STRETCH GOAL:

Is to add in 4 additional color buttons adjacent to the primary buttons for more difficulty and competition. 
Having two iterations one a regular Simon says and the other Advanced with four additional colors.
